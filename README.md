# SQL and POWER-BI-Project
This repository features three projects on data visualization and automation. Using Power BI, I built dashboards for "CineMetrics: A Movie analysis" and "Bank Customer's Analysis", while an SQL project automated Google Forms responses into MySQL via Pabbly Connect, ensuring real-time, structured, and reliable data.
